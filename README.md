## Introduction

Azure OpenAI Proxy is a proxy for Azure OpenAI API that can convert an OpenAI request to an Azure OpenAI request. It is designed to use as a backend for various open source ChatGPT web project. It also supports being used as a simple OpenAI API proxy to solve the problem of OpenAI API being restricted in some regions.

Highlights:

- 🌐 Supports proxying all Azure OpenAI APIs
- 🧠 Supports proxying all Azure OpenAI models and custom fine-tuned models
- 🗺️ Supports custom mapping between Azure deployment names and OpenAI models
- 🔄 Supports both reverse proxy and forward proxy usage
- 👍 Support mocking of OpenAI APIs that are not supported by Azure.


## Supported APIs

The latest version of the Azure OpenAI service currently supports the following 3 APIs:

| Path                  | Status |
| --------------------- | ------ |
| /v1/chat/completions  |  ✅   |
| /v1/completions       | ✅    |
| /v1/embeddings        | ✅    |

> Other APIs not supported by Azure will be returned in a mock format (such as OPTIONS requests initiated by browsers). If you find your project need additional OpenAI-supported APIs, feel free to submit a PR.

## Recently Updated

+ 2023-04-06 supported `/v1/models` interface, fixed the issue of some web projects depending on `models` interface error.
+ 2023-04-04 supported `options` interface, fixed the cross-domain check error issue of some web projects.

## Usage

### 1. Used as reverse proxy (i.e. an OpenAI API gateway)

| AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_MAPPER  | A comma-separated list of model=deployment pairs. Maps model names to deployment names. For example, `gpt-3.5-turbo=gpt-35-turbo`, `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301=gpt-35-turbo-0301`. If there is no match, the proxy will pass model as deployment name directly (in fact, most Azure model names are same with OpenAI). | `gpt-3.5-turbo=gpt-35-turbo`<br/>`gpt-3.5-turbo-0301=gpt-35-turbo-0301` |
| AZURE_OPENAI_TOKEN         | Azure OpenAI API Token. If this environment variable is set, the token in the request header will be ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ""                                                                      |

Use in command line

```shell
curl https://{your-custom-domain}/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {your azure api key}" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

### 2. Used as forward proxy (i.e. an HTTP proxy)

When accessing Azure OpenAI API through HTTP, it can be used directly as a proxy, but this tool does not have built-in HTTPS support, so you need an HTTPS proxy such as Nginx to support accessing HTTPS version of OpenAI API.

Assuming that the proxy domain you configured is `https://{your-domain}.com`, you can execute the following commands in the terminal to use the https proxy:

```shell
export https_proxy=https://{your-domain}.com

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {your azure api key}" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

Or configure it as an HTTP proxy in other open source Web ChatGPT projects:

```
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://{your-domain}.com
```

## Deploy

Deploying through Docker

```shell
docker pull gyarbij/azure-oai-proxy:latest
docker run -d -p 11437:11437 --name=azure-oai-proxy \
  --env AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT={your azure endpoint} \
  --env AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_MAPPER={your custom model mapper ,like: gpt-3.5-turbo=gpt-35-turbo,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301=gpt-35-turbo-0301} \
  gyarbij/azure-oai-proxy:latest
```

Calling

```shell
curl https://localhost:11437/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {your azure api key}" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

## Model Mapping Mechanism

There are a series of rules for model mapping pre-defined in `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_MAPPER`, and the default configuration basically satisfies the mapping of all Azure models. The rules include:

- `gpt-3.5-turbo` -> `gpt-35-turbo`
- `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301` -> `gpt-35-turbo-0301`
- A mapping mechanism that pass model name directly as fallback.

For custom fine-tuned models, the model name can be passed directly. For models with deployment names different from the model names, custom mapping relationships can be defined, such as:

| Model Name         | Deployment Name              |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------- |
| gpt-3.5-turbo      | gpt-35-turbo-upgrade         |
| gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 | gpt-35-turbo-0301-fine-tuned |
